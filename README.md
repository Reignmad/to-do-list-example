# ✅ To-Do List App

Welcome to my **To-Do List App** – a simple, clean, and interactive web application that allows users to keep track of tasks. This project was created for the **GitHub Capstone Assignment** and demonstrates my ability to use key GitHub features such as branching, project boards, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Actions.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This application lets users:
- 📝 Add tasks to a list
- ❌ Remove tasks by clicking on them
- 📋 Stay organised using a lightweight task-tracking interface

It is built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.
